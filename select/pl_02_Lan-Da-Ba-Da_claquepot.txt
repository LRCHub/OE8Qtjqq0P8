Lan Da Ba Da
Everytime Everywhere
Take me there Make me happy
Lan Da Ba Da
Something new Something old
We can see and feel or think
Time goes by like a shooting star
With many wishes
I'm standing like an observatory
Lan Da Ba Da
Sing a song Shout aloud
Set me free Let me fly high
Lan Da Ba Da
“Yes or No”  “Dead or Alive”
I'll be there and get them all
Open the iron door
Without any hesitation
What in the world is there
Let's check and see
Lan Da Ba Da
Everytime Everywhere
Take me there Make me happy
Lan Da Ba Da
Say goodbye Say hello
We do over and over
